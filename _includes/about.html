                      We believe Hong Kong professionals working at the realms of technology and creativity are highly skilled but more than often those skills end up buried deep and unused in organisations.

                      Software development, building more collaborative teams, and achieving overall business agility are just some of the topics that will be covered on the day, through speakers, workshops and chances to network with other Agile thinkers in Hong Kong.

                      It doesn’t matter if you know nothing about Agile, are looking to learn from others, or to share your expertise – there will be something for you on this day. We will have streams covering organisations, people, practices and technology.
